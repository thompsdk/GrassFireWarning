# GrassFireWarning
Code and data to support grassland fire warning criteria and identifying grassland wildfires in satellite hotspots

The data reproduces and builds upon the modelling presented in Thompson and Morrison (2020; https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3439-2020)

The underlying data for the Thompson and Morrison paper is found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3764192

This repository will reproduce the main Generalized Additive Model found in the 2020 paper, as well as the decision tree diagram.

Planned expansions to the original paper include: (1) constrained GAMs using the scam R package; (2) use of Pepin and Wotton (https://doi.org/10.3390/fire3030034) open hourly FFMC scheme.
